## Documentation

**GitBounty is a Web3 app which allows GitHub users to create bounties on their Github issues.**

It does this by using smart contract to automatically monitor the Github API with Chainlink Functions and Chainlink Automation.

Contract live on eth-sepolia testnet:

Run the frontend in this repo to interface with the contract and create bounties of your Github issues.

Open source collaboration is the backbone of modern software, but financial incentives are often misaligned or entirely absent. Maintainers struggle to get help on critical issues, contributors lack clear pathways to compensation, and sponsors have little transparency into what their funds achieve.

**GitBounty** solves this by turning GitHub issues into open, permissionless bounties. It creates a decentralised incentive layer for software collaboration.

It is a working implementation of a generalised protocol I designed for incentivising work, called the _Universal Bounty Protocol (UBP)_. It follows a four-stage structure:

request ‚Üí work ‚Üí verification ‚Üí approval

**GitBounty** applies this model directly to GitHub development workflows:

- **Request**: The GitHub issue title and description serve as a formal request to modify a project‚Äôs code to meet specific criteria.
- **Work**: Developers respond by submitting code changes (e.g., pull requests) that aim to satisfy the request.
- **Verification**: Reviewers assess whether the submitted work meets the outlined requirements.
- **Approval**: A final decision-making process (e.g., merge or review consensus) determines whether the contributor is rewarded.

This structure allows open-source projects to define and enforce their own contribution standards, while enabling automated and transparent financial incentives on-chain.

With **GitBounty**, you can:

üí∏ Attach bounties to issues
Let anyone fund tasks they care about, not just repo maintainers.

üîç Automate contribution verification
Uses smart contracts and Chainlink Functions to monitor the GitHub API and detect issue resolution or pull request merges.

‚õì Trustless payouts
Automatically sends rewards to contributors once work is verified, reducing friction and disputes.

ü§ù Incentivise outside help
Attract contributors beyond your core team by providing clear, visible rewards.

üõ° Reduce grant misuse
Sponsors and DAOs can fund public goods with greater assurance that funds are tied to completed work.

Whether you're a solo dev maintaining a side project, a DAO funding critical infrastructure, or a contributor seeking paid opportunities, **GitBounty** creates a new incentive structure that rewards open source work transparently and automatically.

Looking forward, each stage of the UBP could be augmented or fully automated by AI. From generating work proposals to writing code and verifying correctness, this could create a powerful new paradigm: a decentralised, competitive market of work for AI software developer agents.

Bounty contracts could be ownable, tradable, and packaged into a new class of on-chain assets - earning fees for their holders and effectively financialising the online gig economy of software development.

**Technical Challenges**
One major limitation was the lack of secure secret management within Chainlink Automation. Chainlink Functions requires a GitHub token to query the API, but Automation can't store or inject secrets directly.

To work around this, I embedded a read-only GitHub token with narrow permissions directly into the on-chain Functions JavaScript script. This allowed for full end-to-end automation without central servers or manual intervention, but at the cost of ideal security.

**Theoretical Design Challenges**
While the Universal Bounty Protocol (UBP) aims to create a trust-minimised workflow, some stages, particularly approval, cannot be made fully trustless. The decision to merge a GitHub pull request remains subjective and human-driven.

To address this, GitBounty embraces flexible trust models by allowing each project to define its own PR approver structure. This could range from a single maintainer to a decentralised reviewer committee.

This led to a broader insight:

Many types of work can be formalised as proposal ‚Üí work ‚Üí verification ‚Üí approval processes, each with different degrees of trust minimisation.

By clearly defining the trust boundaries and where discretion enters the process, users can better understand both the value and risk of each bounty.

## Usage

General usage is as follows:
Developers to register their github username and wallet address in the registry.

Then, given an existing Github repo, with open issues available, a user can create a bounty on an issue by entering the details and funding it with ETH. The bounty can be funded multiple times, by multiple users.

Once a branched PR (linked to the bounty's issue) has been merged successfully into the main branch, the Bounty will automatically pay out to the author of the PR.

Test Create and Delete bounty

1. `make createAndFundBounty`
2. `make deleteAndRefundBounty`

Test start to finish (with automation)

1. Register new custom logic upkeep, using contract address https://automation.chain.link/new-custom-logic
2. `make mapGithubUsername`
3. `make createAndFundBounty`
4. let functions / upkeep auto-run by chainlink automation.

### Deploy

```shell
`make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"`
```

Register the contract address in a new Chainlink Automation Upkeep
Register the contract address as a consumer of the Chainlink Functions subscription
